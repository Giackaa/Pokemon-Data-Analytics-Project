# Pokemon-Data-Analytics-Project
## Project Highlights

**Python**
- Web Scraping: Scraped dynamically loaded websites using selenium and requests

- Data Processing: Combined for / while loops, try-except blocks, list comprehensions, and pandas DataFrames

- Optimized Code: Used ternary operators and regular expressions to clean and transform data

- Data Manipulation: Reorganized and aggregated scraped data with pandas for analysis

**MySQL**
- Complex Queries: Wrote queries with 100+ lines, merging CTEs, CASE statements, and unions

- Advanced Analytics: Applied window functions (RANK, LEAD) with CTEs to compare cross-generation Pokémon stats

- Tier Analysis: Identified most prevalent type/ability in tiers using window and aggregate functions

- Classification: Used table joins and CTEs to classify Pokémon as new or existing

- Performance Metrics: Calculated stat differences between new and old Pokémon

**Tableau**
- Interactive Dashboards: Built dashboards that respond to generation selection

- LODs & Benchmarks: Used LOD expressions to compare statistical percentage differences between high-tier Pokémon

- Meta Analysis:

  - Identified top types/abilities per meta tier

  - Compared average stats of new vs. existing Pokemon

  - Uncovered trends of new Pokemon consistently outperforming existing ones in average stats, especially in speed

  - Analyzed compared how often new vs. existing Pokemon are placed in high tiers

  - Showcased statistical balance patches from Gen 1 to Gen 9 to understand evolving game meta
